# Icons ðŸ§³

## Agnostic Image Injection

This is an experimental library that isolates the specifics of adding icons into a web application.  By providing a common interface to various icon libraries (currently only Bootstrap) it *should* be easy to switch between different sets of icons.

I am not yet committed to using this in any "real" code.  Feedback is very welcome!
